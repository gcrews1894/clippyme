"""URL helpers for resolving disk filenames from video_url references.

All backend consumers that need to turn a clip's ``video_url`` into a
filesystem path should go through :func:`filename_from_video_url` so
that cache-busting query strings (``?v=1234567``), fragments (``#t=3``)
and leading/trailing whitespace never leak into a filesystem lookup.

Historically we had half a dozen call sites each doing
``video_url.split("/")[-1]`` which broke after the reframe endpoint
started appending ``?v=...`` — see the bug fix in the commit that
introduced this module.

    Safe against:
      - ``None`` or empty input (returns ``""``)
      - Query strings: ``/videos/abc/clip_1.mp4?v=1234`` → ``clip_1.mp4``
      - Fragments:     ``/videos/abc/clip_1.mp4#t=5``   → ``clip_1.mp4``
      - Leading/trailing whitespace
      - Trailing slashes
      - Backslashes on Windows-style paths

    This does NOT sanitize the filename against path traversal — callers
    that join it with an output directory are already expected to
    validate the result with ``is_valid_job_id`` + path containment
    checks before opening the file.
